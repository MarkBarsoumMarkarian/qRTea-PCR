qRTea Time — How to qPCR like a boss

1. Upload your raw PCR Excel file:
Drop that .xlsx file with your samples, targets, and Cq values. Make sure it has these columns exactly: Sample, Target, and Cq.

2. Pick your reference gene(s):
The app will show you which reference genes it found in your data. Pick 1 or 2 to normalize your results. (If unsure, pick the ones with stable expression!)

3. Name your control sample:
This is your baseline. All fold changes will be calculated relative to this sample. Make sure the name matches exactly the sample name in your file!

4. Hit “Crunch the Numbers”:
Sit back while qRTea does the heavy lifting — mean Ct, SD, CV%, ΔCt, ΔΔCt, fold change, M-values… all the stats you need.

5. Explore your results:

    Summary Table: overview of your Ct values and stats

    M-values: check gene stability for your reference genes

    Delta Fold Change: see the relative expression changes

    Fold Change Plot: visualize your data by sample & gene

6. Optional extras:

    Upload CRISPR validation data to compare fold changes side-by-side

    Upload miRNA target predictions to find overlaps with your PCR results

7. Download your files:
Choose what you want to save — summary tables, M-values, fold change tables, or a full HTML report — then click the download button.
Pro Tips 💡

    Double-check your reference genes — stable refs make your results legit.

    Control sample name must be exact, or no fold change calculation.

    Technical replicates get averaged automatically — no extra prep needed.

    If something breaks, check your Excel formatting first (especially column names).
